                It's important to make your website accesible to everyone. Even
                today it's common to find a website that was not designed and
                developed for people with disabilities in mind.

                HTML has a special place in my heart, everybody loves a hello,
                world in the console but i think making a webpage that you can
                run a hello world in sounds like the fourth wall break we've all
                been waiting for.

                This is where things really started to get cool, my websites

                elegant UI's and working with the user's of my products to
                improve the UX of my designs!

              <p>
                My time with SQL has been short, but that doesn't mean it hasn't
                been profound. My first SQL Professor showed me the capabilities
                of this seemingly overlooked language. I'm excited to continue
                my learning in data, SQL, and in DBMS.

              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>
                This is one of those languages that truly begins to test you.
                There's one thing that can be said about a challenge, it's the
                true path to growth. Object Oriented Programming is a staple in
                programming, and I think Java is the perfect place to kick it
                off.

                The iconic hello world, on your parent's laptop, the good old
                days. If you're talking about data, Python is going to get name
                dropped somewhere. With so many libraries like Pygame and Pandas
                you can do so much, not to mention Python's importance in
                Generative AI and the now common place LLMs.

              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>
                If CSS can take your builds to a professional level, JavaScript
                takes it to the Moon. It enamors me every time how a seemingly
                static "board" becomes a living-thing. My extent of JavaScript
                is using open-source librarys like particles.js to add inticing
                backgrounds, and Firebase which I've been learning about while
                working on a Comment Board project.
